# Official Badge System Roadmap
**Feature:** Verification badges for organizations and users  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  

## Overview
Create a verification system that allows admins to mark organizations (and later users) as "official" with a visible badge on their profiles.

## Phase 1: Database Schema & Backend (Week 1)

### 1.1 Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Add `isVerified` boolean field to organizations table
- [ ] Add `verifiedAt` timestamp field for audit trail
- [ ] Add `verifiedBy` field (admin user ID who verified)
- [ ] Create migration script for existing organizations

### 1.2 Backend API Endpoints
- [ ] Add verification field to organization model
- [ ] Update organization routes to include verification status
- [ ] Create admin-only endpoint to toggle verification
- [ ] Update search results to include verification status
- [ ] Update profile endpoint to return verification status

### 1.3 Admin Permission System
- [ ] Create admin role/permission system
- [ ] Add middleware to check admin permissions
- [ ] Secure verification endpoints for admin-only access

## Phase 2: Frontend UI Components (Week 2)

### 2.1 Badge Component
- [ ] Create reusable `VerificationBadge` component
- [ ] Design badge icon (checkmark in circle)
- [ ] Add hover tooltip explaining verification
- [ ] Support different sizes (small, medium, large)

### 2.2 Profile Integration
- [ ] Add badge to organization profile cards
- [ ] Display badge in business listings
- [ ] Show badge in search results
- [ ] Add badge to business directory

### 2.3 Admin Interface
- [ ] Create admin panel for managing verifications
- [ ] Add verification toggle in business settings (admin-only)
- [ ] Show verification history/audit trail

## Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Week 3)

### 3.1 Visual Design
- [ ] Finalize badge design with design system colors
- [ ] Ensure accessibility (proper contrast, alt text)
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- [ ] Animation for badge appearance

### 3.2 User Experience
- [ ] Add verification request process for organizations
- [ ] Email notifications for verification status changes
- [ ] Help documentation for verification process

### 3.3 Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit tests for verification logic
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Manual testing of UI components
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE organization ADD COLUMN is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE organization ADD COLUMN verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE organization ADD COLUMN verified_by TEXT NULL;
```

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/organizations/:id - Include verification status
PATCH /api/admin/organizations/:id/verify - Admin only
PATCH /api/admin/organizations/:id/unverify - Admin only
GET /api/admin/organizations/verification-requests - Pending requests
```

### Component Structure
```
VerificationBadge/
├── index.tsx - Main component
├── types.ts - TypeScript types
├── styles.ts - Styled components
└── VerificationBadge.stories.tsx - Storybook stories
```

## Future Enhancements (Phase 4+)

### User Verification
- [ ] Extend system to support user verification
- [ ] Different badge types (business, individual, government)
- [ ] Verification levels (basic, premium, government)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Verification criteria checklist
- [ ] Automated verification for certain domains
- [ ] Verification analytics and reporting
- [ ] API for third-party verification services

### Integration Features
- [ ] Verification status in API responses
- [ ] Webhook notifications for verification changes
- [ ] Bulk verification tools for admins

## Implementation Priority

### Must Have (MVP)
1. Database schema with `isVerified` field
2. Backend API to toggle verification (admin only)
3. Frontend badge component
4. Badge display on organization profiles

### Should Have
1. Admin permission system
2. Verification audit trail
3. Badge in search results and listings
4. Hover tooltips with explanation

### Nice to Have
1. Verification request process
2. Email notifications
3. Admin dashboard for managing verifications
4. Analytics and reporting

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Verification endpoints must be admin-only
- Rate limiting on verification requests
- Audit logging for all verification changes

### Performance
- Cache verification status for fast lookups
- Optimize queries to include verification in bulk operations
- Consider CDN for badge icons

### Scalability
- Design schema to support multiple verification types
- Consider future expansion to user verification
- Plan for potential verification automation

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Number of verified organizations
- [ ] Admin satisfaction with verification tools
- [ ] User recognition of verified badges
- [ ] Reduced fake/spam organization profiles

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Badge abuse or fake verification
  - **Mitigation:** Strong admin-only controls, audit trails
- **Risk:** Performance impact of additional queries
  - **Mitigation:** Proper indexing and caching
- **Risk:** User confusion about verification criteria
  - **Mitigation:** Clear documentation and help text

# Comments System Implementation Roadmap

## âœ… V1 COMPLETE - Production Ready

### Implementation Summary
Full-featured commenting system with threaded discussions for linkBD posts. Users and organizations can create, edit, delete comments with single-level nesting (comment + replies).

### API Endpoints
```
GET    /api/posts/:id/comments                    // List comments with pagination
POST   /api/posts/:id/comments                    // Create comment/reply
GET    /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId/replies  // Get replies with pagination
PUT    /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId          // Update comment
DELETE /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId          // Delete comment
```

### Frontend Usage
```tsx
import { CommentsSection } from '@/components/comments'

<CommentsSection postId={postId} />
```

### V1 Phases Completed
- [x] **Phase 1:** Database schema with polymorphic authors
- [x] **Phase 2:** Model layer with CRUD operations & permissions  
- [x] **Phase 3:** RESTful API with auth & validation
- [x] **Phase 4:** React Query hooks with optimistic updates
- [x] **Phase 5:** Comment display components with infinite scroll
- [x] **Phase 6:** Comment creation/editing UI with keyboard shortcuts
- [x] **Phase 6.1:** Post detail route (`/posts/:id`) for viewing & commenting
 - [x] **Phase 6.5:** Mobile App Parity â€” Implemented comments and replies in the mobile app using unified RPC hooks, a reusable `CommentsList` + `CommentCard`, and a dedicated comment thread route with a sticky bottom composer. Tapping any comment navigates to its thread.

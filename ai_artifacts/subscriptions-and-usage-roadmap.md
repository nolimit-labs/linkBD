- [ ] Add billing management for mobile users
- [ ] Display Pro/Official badges consistently

**Target Files**:
- `apps/mobile-app/src/components/posts/`

- [ ] Integration tests for `/api/posts/limits` endpoint
- [ ] E2E test: reach daily limit scenario
- [ ] E2E test: upgrade flow from free to pro
- [ ] E2E test: UTC midnight reset behavior
- [ ] Subscription cancelation and reactivation tests
- [ ] Test organization vs personal post limits

**Test Categories**:
- Backend middleware tests
- API endpoint tests
- Frontend component tests
- Full user journey tests

### Phase 9: Documentation & Monitoring
- [ ] Developer documentation for subscription system

## Success Criteria
- [x] Daily limits enforced consistently (backend + frontend) ‚úÖ
- [x] Clear UX messaging about limits and upgrades ‚úÖ
- [x] No performance regressions with indexes ‚úÖ
- [x] Billing settings provide clear upgrade path ‚úÖ
- [x] Badge components are reusable and consistent ‚úÖ
- [ ] Mobile app has feature parity
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] Documentation covers all subscription features
- [ ] Monitoring shows usage patterns and bottlenecks

## Technical Architecture

### Key Design Decisions
1. **UTC Timezone**: All daily limits reset at UTC midnight for consistency
2. **Environment Variables**: Pricing configured via `VITE_PRO_PLAN_PRICE`
3. **Component Architecture**: Self-contained dialogs with triggers
4. **Badge System**: Centralized badge components for consistency
5. **Error Handling**: Toast notifications with actionable messages

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/posts/limits` - Get current usage and limits
- `POST /api/posts` - Create post (enforces limits)
- Billing portal via Better Auth integration

### Database Schema
- Posts table with composite indexes for performance
- Subscription data managed by Better Auth
- Daily counting optimized with (userId, createdAt) indexes


## Next Priority Actions

1. **Database Migration** (if not done):
   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

2. **Mobile App Updates**:
   - Start with usage display hooks
   - Add upgrade UI components
   - Test on iOS and Android

3. **Testing Suite**:
   - Write unit tests for limit logic
   - Add E2E tests for upgrade flow
   - Test edge cases (timezone boundaries)

## Notes for Developers

### Adding New Plan Features
1. Update `PlanLimits` interface in `plans/data.ts`
2. Add enforcement in subscription middleware
3. Update frontend display components
4. Add tests for new limits

### Modifying Pricing
1. Set `VITE_PRO_PLAN_PRICE` environment variable
2. Pricing automatically updates in all UI components
3. Ensure Stripe product pricing matches

### Badge System Usage
```tsx
import { OfficialBadge } from '@/components/profile/official-badge'
import { ProBadge } from '@/components/profile/premium-badge'

// Usage
{user.isOfficial && <OfficialBadge className="text-xs" />}
{user.isPro && <ProBadge className="text-xs" />}
```

# Feature Implementation Roadmap Generator

## Prompt

Create a concise implementation roadmap for a new feature. The roadmap should be a living document that gets updated as phases are executed, with an implementation progress list that tracks completion status.

### Roadmap Template Example:

---

# [Feature Name] Implementation Roadmap

> üìù **Living Document** - This roadmap is actively updated as phases are executed. Check items off as completed. Also update the roadmap with any additional work done. Everything should be documented.

## Overview
[Brief description of the feature and its business value]

## Implementation Progress

*Note: These phases are just placeholders. Create whatever phases make sense for your feature in any order you need.*

- [ ] Phase 1: [Your Phase Name] 
- [ ] Phase 2: [Your Phase Name] 
- [ ] Phase 3: [Your Phase Name] 
- [ ] Phase 4: [Your Phase Name] 

## Phase Instructions

### Phase 1: [Your Phase Name]

### Instructions:
1. Replace all placeholders with your specific feature details
2. Phases can be anything you need: research, design, database, API, UI, testing, deployment, documentation, etc.
3. Tasks should be specific and actionable for your feature
4. Add or remove phases and tasks as needed for your specific implementation
5. The template structure is just a starting point - customize it completely to fit your needs
6. Check off tasks as completed and update the roadmap with any additional work discovered
7. Keep this document current throughout the entire implementation process
8. Use this as a communication tool with stakeholders to show progress and plan ahead

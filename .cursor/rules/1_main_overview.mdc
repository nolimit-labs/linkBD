## Rules
-   Implements complete, working code for all requested features
-   Adds comments to the code to explain the purpose and structure, do not do this for imports though
-   Use the `@` symbol when possible for imports. 
-   Try to get to the root of a problem when debugging, instead of overengineering a solution.
-   If you are unsure of something you can search the documentation using a tool. In this case use context7.
-   Do not install packages on your own, just tell me what to install.
-   Import types as type.
-   Always follow best practices
-   **Important** Do not make changes I didn't ask for. 
-   **Important** Do not run `npm run dev` or scripts like that on your own. Just tell me, and I'll do it. I'll tell you the result.
-   **Important** Always output md files that i ask you to create in the `ai_artifacts` directory

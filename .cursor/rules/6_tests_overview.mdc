# E2E Tests Overview


---

## Package: `apps/e2e-tests`

End-to-end testing for the linkBD application using Playwright.

---

## Structure

-   **`tests/`**: Test files (*.spec.ts)
    - `main.spec.ts`: contains the main tests, like auth, payment, adn webhook related xstuff
-   **`pages/`**: Page Object Models for reusable page interactions
-   **`utils/`**: Test utilities and helpers

---

## Rules

-   Follow Page Object Model pattern when writing test
-   Use descriptive test names
-   **Prioritize `data-testid` selectors first** - If an element has a data-testid attribute, use it as the primary selector (e.g., `page.locator('[data-testid="user-name"]')`). Check the client code components to find available data-testids
-   Target user-facing elements (`getByRole`, `getByText`) only when data-testid is not available
-   Tests run against unauthenticated and authenticated flows

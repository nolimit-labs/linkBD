# Mobile App (Expo + NativeWind)

Concise overview of the mobile app package.

## Stack
- React Native, Expo Router, TypeScript
- React Query
- Hono RPC (type-safe API)
- Better Auth (Expo plugin + SecureStore)
- NativeWind (Tailwind for RN)

## Structure
- `app/` Expo Router screens
  - `(auth)/` unauthenticated routes
  - `(app)/` authenticated app: parent Stack. `(app)/(drawer)` is the topâ€‘level Drawer; detail screens (`posts/[id]`, `posts/[postId]/comments/[commentId]`, `profile/[id]`) are Stack screens in `(app)` (siblings to `(drawer)`) for proper back transitions. All Stack headers use the LinkBD logo via `headerTitle: () => <Logo />`.
- `api/` networking via centralized `rpc-client.ts`
- `lib/` shared libs (e.g., `auth-client.ts`, `icons/`, `utils.ts`, `useColorScheme.tsx`, `constants.ts`)
- `components/` UI primitives (e.g., `ui/button.tsx`, `ui/card.tsx`), `ThemeToggle.tsx`
- `providers/` contains different providers for the app
- `assets/` contains all the assets for the app
- `global.css` contains the global styles for the app (Currently Unused)
- `tailwind.config.js` contains the tailwind config for the app
- `app.json` contains the expo app config for the app

Additional Notes:

* **Auth:** `lib/auth-client.ts` with Better Auth (Expo + SecureStore); `api/rpc-client.ts` forwards `authClient.getCookie()` for RPC.
* **NativeWind:** Tailwind via `className`; CSS built from `global.css`, and `tailwind.config.js`.

## Rules
- Use kebab-case for files (e.g., `new-todo-form.tsx`).
- Use `@/` or `~` aliases from `tsconfig`.
- All network calls go through `api/rpc-client.ts` and hooks colocated in `api/`.
- Apply all styles as Tailwind classes, via NativeWind.
